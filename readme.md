# ClearFrame

ClearFrame is a custom photo slideshow application designed to run on my Nixplay W13D digital frame. I wrote it to replace the original software on the frame when Nixplay started charging subscription prices to load photos via the cloud. 

The application syncs and displays photos from a server hosted on my home Synology - I named it "ClearFrame" because it's not cloudy.
